    <h3 class="mt-5"><b>Software Engineer and Co-Founder</b></h3>
    <p>So far throughout my years at university, I've noticed a problem: a lot of people have a business idea or have an actual business, but don't know how to build the tech side of their venture. That's why my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyngo1199/">Danny Ngo</a> and I took it upon ourselves to solve this problem and created DeltaStack.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">At deltaStack, we work with businesses and companies to build their tech infrastructure in a scalable and secure way. As a software engineer for deltaStack, I've build schema models for databases and worked with API endpoints to make backends for platforms, implemented secure password systems and authentication security with different libraries so we comply to industry standards, and applied Agile while running meetings and deciding on features so that we finish client projects ahead of schedule. As a co-founder, I also make executive decisions on the company's culture, financial structuring, and growth direction and strategy.
    </p>
    <p<br><br>I am really excited about the future of this company; there's so much potential and I'm passionate about the work, particularly since it's something that you very much own, and it's wholly up to you how big it gets and you have full freedom over decisions.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5"><b>Business Systems Analyst</b></h3>
    <p>I wanted to apply the knowledge and skills that I'd learned in school and make a contribution in industry. My internship at TD Bank was a great way for me not only accomplish my aim, but to also learn valuable tech and interpersonal skills as well.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">I got to work on the Strategic Risk Management team in Infrastructure and Technology Solutions. I got to work on a lot of cool stuff; some of the things I did were create a script in Visual Basic that worked with Microsoft Applications and our team's intranet site to automate Senior Management processes, do some high level risk analysis on tech infrastructure control gaps, and in general learn how Risk Analysis teams work within large organizations such as one of the biggest banks in North America.

    <p>I wanted to get involved in building a real world software product and also work on my product management skills; Ivey FinTech was the stone that hit both of those birds.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">I get to lead a team of developers to build a web app platform that helps Western students organize their studies. I like that I get to decide on the product's architecture and I also like that I have to work with the other developer and business leads, as well as the Vice Presidents of the portfolio.

    <p>This summer I really wanted to improve my coding skills and gain some real world experience in software development. I decided that contibuting to open source would be the best way to address both my wishes.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">I contributed towards the back-end of the VOC project sector, which is a transpiler that converts Python bytecode to Java bytecode. <br><br>My contributions included: <br><br><ul>
    <li>Implementing Python built-ins in Java</li>
